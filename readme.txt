Have different primary menus for different viewers.

== Description ==

I once thought I need different primary menus for different viewers.
In best case those users have a GET paramter which decides which menu has to be shown.

For Example: 
You go into WordPress and add a menu with a name of your choice. I choosed "music".
Now if you want somebody view the music menu you have the parameter http://www.example.com/?view=music.
You can do this with every menu you have.

In case you leave it empty nothing happen at all.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'GET-Different-Menus' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
